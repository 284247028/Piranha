Piranha.Extensions
==================
This project contains some core regions & extensions for Piranha but also serves 
as an example of how to build a self-contained module with plugin-behaviour. 

These components are not distributed with the base package but will be distribited as 
a separate NuGet-package that can be installed on top of the Piranha CMS template.

These extensions are licensed under the Apache license which means you can modify the
extensions do to whatever you want without any strings attached. For more information
please refer to LICENSE.md
