Welcome to Piranha 
==================
This is the core library for the Piranha CMS framework. If your primary interest
is developing end-user applications and not poking around in the core classes, 
consider forking or downoading the template repository instead.

Documentation and information about the project can be found on our main site:

We're currently working hard to get to initial version and this of course means
that there's a LOT of commits to the master branch at this stage. Any issues or
requests on are welcome in the issue list!
