# Welcome to Piranha CMS

Piranha CMS is a **lightweight** framework for building content driven applications using ASP.NET MVC & Web Pages. The main focus of the framework lies in structuring and managing content, not in providing a pre packaged web interface. 

Piranha CMS can be used to build a new application from scratch, or to add CMS functionality to an already existing application. 

## License

Piranha CMS is released under the **MIT** license.

The master branch of this reposiory is the **development branch**. If you want to use the source code that resembles the current NuGet-version, **DO NOT** use the master branch. Instead, use the branch with the same name as the current version on NuGet. 

## NuGet packages

There are NuGet packages available for both the template projects, as well as for the core libraries. To read more about how to get started and the different packages available, please refer to the official site at:
