Welcome to PiranhaCMS
=====================
This is the main repository for PiranhaCMS which contains the core libraries
as well as the template site you can use as a starting point to create a new
web site.

PiranhaCMS is a lightweight framework for building CMS-based web applications
using .NET MVC & ASP.NET WebPages with Razor syntax. The main goal of the
project is to offer a framework which is appealing for both the developer as
well as the content manager while leveraging as much as possible of the core
functionality in the .NET framework.

The core libraries are distributed with the the Gnu LGPL License while the template 
site is distributed with the Apache 2.0 License. For more information, please 
read the README files located in the different project folders.

The template site together with the precompiled core libraries are also available 
as a NuGet package:
